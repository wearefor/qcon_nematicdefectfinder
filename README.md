# qcon_nematicdefectfinder
MATLAB functions that identify topological half-integer defects in a nematic director field. Scripts use MATLABâ€™s conv2() function with a ring kernel to recursively perform line integrals that calculate the local topological index, producing a map that is then searched for regions of non-zero index. 

Files:
1. call_plotdefects.m  :  example usage
2. func_defectfind.m   :  core-function, identifies locations of half-integer defects provided a director field {nx, ny} in gridded form
3. func_defectorient.m :  identifies orientation of half-integer defects
4. func_gencircle.m    :  builds kernel for convolution
5. sampleframe         :  data used in example
